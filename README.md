This is a demo application illustrating various features used in everyday web development, with a fine touch of best practices. The demo app is a blog application where users can signup, create an article, delete an article and add comments etc.

## Boilerplate

Want to build something from scratch? use the [boilerplate](https://github.com/madhums/node-express-mongoose)

- Checkout the [apps that are built using this approach](https://github.com/madhums/node-express-mongoose/wiki/Apps-built-using-this-approach)
- The [wiki](https://github.com/madhums/node-express-mongoose/wiki) is wip, it has some information about the way application is setup.

## Install

```sh
git clone git://github.com/madhums/node-express-mongoose-demo.git
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm start
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

**NOTE:** Do not forget to set the twitter, google, linkedin and github `CLIENT_ID`s and `SECRET`s. In `development` env, you can set the env variables in `.env` and replace the values there. In `production` env, it is not safe to keep the ids and secrets in a file, so you need to set it up via commandline. If you are using heroku checkout how environment variables are set [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).

## Tests

```sh
npm test
```

## Docker

You can also use docker for development. Make sure you run npm install on your host machine so that code linting and everything works fine.

```sh
npm i
cp .env.example .env
```

Start the services

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

View the logs

```sh
docker-compose logs -f
```

In case you install a npm module while developing, it should also be installed within docker container, to do this first install the module you want with simple `npm i module name`, then run it within docker container

```sh
docker-compose exec node npm i
```

If you make any changes to the file, nodemon should automatically pick up and restart within docker (you can see this in the logs)

To run tests

```sh
docker-compose exec -e MONGODB_URL=mongodb://mongo:27017/noobjs_test node npm test
```

Note that we are overriding the environment variable set in `.env` file because we don't want our data erased by the tests.

Note: The difference between exec and run is that, exec executes the command within the running container and run will spin up a new container to run that command. So if you want to run only the tests without docker-compose up, you may do so by running `docker-compose run -e MONGODB_URL=mongodb://mongo:27017/noobjs_test node npm test`

## Runtime Config

create-react-app itself supports [configuration with environment variables](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables). These compile-time variables are embedded in the bundle during the build process, and may go stale when the app slug is promoted through a pipeline or otherwise changed without a rebuild. See create-react-app-buildpack's docs for further elaboration of [compile-time vs runtime variables](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack/blob/master/README.md#user-content-compile-time-vs-runtime).

[create-react-app-buildpack's runtime config](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack/blob/master/README.md#user-content-runtime-configuration) makes it possible to dynamically change variables, no rebuild required. That runtime config technique may be applied to Node.js based apps such as this one.

1. Add the inner buildpack to your app, so that the `heroku/nodejs` buildpack is last:

   ```bash
   heroku buildpacks:add -i 1 https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-inner-buildpack

   # Verify that create-react-app-inner-buildpack comes before nodejs
   heroku buildpacks
   ```

2. Set the bundle location for runtime config injection:

   ```bash
   heroku config:set JS_RUNTIME_TARGET_BUNDLE='/app/react-ui/build/static/js/*.js'
   ```

3. Now, build the app with this new setup:

   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m 'Enable runtime config with create-react-app-inner-buildpack'
   git push heroku master
   ```

# running locally

## Client

npm run start

```java
# ./react-ui/react-scripts start
http://localhost:3000/

# cd react-ui && npm run start
```

## Server

node ./server/index.js

```java
http://localhost:5000/api

## Deploy to Heroku

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mars/heroku-cra-node.git
cd heroku-cra-node/
heroku create
git push heroku master
